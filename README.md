I find this article pretty interesting and feel like it could be related to the price of Bitcoin going up. It could be related to how our brain perceives the value of a token. Seeing yourself hold 1 BTC in contrast to 200,000 DOGE you would think that the higher the number of tokens that you are holding the more valuable it is. Not only that but the more tokens you hold the more you are inclined to think that the value of that token will exponentially increase sometimes not taking into account the market cap of the token. With that being said I think that as one look at their wallet and sees a large amount of tokens in it, they feel more confident in their ability to make a purchase.
